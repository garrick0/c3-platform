## 🔧 Configuration Changes Made

### Package Naming Convention
```
Before: c3-shared
After:  @garrick0/c3-shared
```

### Version Strategy
```
Development: 0.1.0-dev.{sha}
Canary:      0.1.0-canary.1
Stable:      0.1.0
```

### Registry Configuration
```bash
# .npmrc
@garrick0:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${NODE_AUTH_TOKEN}
```

### Publish Configuration

## ⚠️ Issues & Blockers

### Current Issues
None

### Resolved Issues
1. **CI Approach Clarification** ✅
   - Initial implementation tried to build dependencies from source in CI
   - Corrected to use published packages from GitHub Packages
   - This is the correct approach: Publish once, consume everywhere
   - Result: Simplified workflows, faster CI, proper versioning

### Potential Blockers
- [ ] Need GitHub PAT token for cross-repo triggers (Phase 1.3)
- [ ] May need to verify GitHub Packages permissions
- [ ] Need to coordinate team for testing phase

## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Scoped Package Name**: Using `@garrick0` scope
   - Rationale: Matches GitHub username, follows npm conventions

2. **Version Strategy**: Pre-release tags for dev/canary
   - Rationale: Clear distinction between development and production

3. **Auto-publish on Main**: Dev versions publish automatically
   - Rationale: Continuous integration, fast feedback

4. **Manual Stable Releases**: Require workflow dispatch
   - Rationale: Control over production versions

### Implementation Strategy
- Bottom-up approach: Start with leaf packages (c3-shared)
- Test each package before moving to next
- Parallel work possible after c3-shared is published

---

## 🎯 Next Actions

### Immediate (Today)
1. Complete c3-compliance configuration
2. Complete c3-projection configuration
3. Complete c3-discovery configuration
4. Test publishing c3-shared to GitHub Packages

### Tomorrow
1. Configure c3-wiring
2. Create orchestrator workflow
3. Test end-to-end pipeline

### This Week
1. Update application CIs
2. Run full integration tests
3. Document new workflows

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] CI times reduced by >70%
- [ ] Zero manual intervention needed
- [ ] Team onboarded successfully

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If issues arise, follow these steps:

1. **Quick Rollback** (< 5 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Revert to file:// dependencies
   npm install c3-shared@file:../c3-shared
   ```

2. **Full Rollback** (< 1 hour)
   - Revert package.json changes
   - Remove .npmrc files
   - Disable publish workflows
   - Re-enable npm link setup

3. **Partial Rollback** (keep what works)
   - Keep published packages
   - Use for stable releases only
   - Fall back to file:// for development
